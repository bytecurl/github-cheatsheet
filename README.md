## The GitHub Git Cheat Sheet in Markdown

Whether you're a complete Git noob, a seasoned full-stack developer or somewhere in between, there might be times you need to look up some basic commands when working with GitHub. To all of our rescue and in case you missed it, there is the official GitHub Git Cheat Sheet at [training.github.com](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/). And in case you also missed the GitHub Git Cheat Sheet PDF completely and want to download it from education.github.com, [here's the link](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf). Now as Markdown is the preferred language for many people and to save you the hassle to work with a buggy PDF when it comes to copying and pasting codes, here's the complete GitHub Git Cheat Sheet in an easy to access linear form.

*`In fact there are some commands missing in the official web version that are included in the PDF and vice versa, so to create this repo with all the information in one batch really makes sense.`*

    The content provided is as shown in the official documentation and combined from the GitHub website and PDF and will be updated as soon any updates have been made to them. As to the credits, there is no copyright violation intended and all the contents have clearly been created by the fantastic staff of our favorite online version control provider and are owned by GitHub, Inc.

If you are desperately looking for a more comprehensive cheat sheet for GitHub, I recommend my upcoming repository __*`github-cheatsheet-ultimate`*__ (Coming Soon) with many more commands, tricks, codes and workarounds for your daily work with GitHub.

## For now, "Happy gitting!"
